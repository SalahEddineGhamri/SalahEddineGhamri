- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about path planning algorithms
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on robotics and embeded software
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with rust compiler and rust lang
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about robotics and autonomous driving
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: linked in
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: them 
- âš¡ Fun fact: writing code for living is no fun :P
